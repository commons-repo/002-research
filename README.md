# Systems for generating and transforming point clouds

This project presents a set of lightweight, human-in-the-loop systems for generating point clouds as the foundational “DNA” of shapes and CAD models. 
By treating points as fundamental geometric units, the project emphasizes transparent, creativity-driven methods that avoid dependencies on commercial tools and reduce computational overhead. 
The aim is to make point-cloud creation simple, accessible, and practical for applications in CAD modeling, geometric prototyping, and reverse engineering.
